# Lesion-Detection-using-Mammograms
 The model will take as input a mammogram image and output a prediction of whether or not there is a cancerous lesion in the image. The goal is to create a system that can automatically classify images into predefined categories.

 A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. Mammograms can be used to check for breast cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. This type of mammogram is called a screening mammogram. Screening mammograms usually involve two or more x-ray pictures, or images, of each breast

 Here I'm  trying to classify the mammograms  Malignant or benign (1 or 0) using deeplearning techniques.
 First Im trying to implement VGG in Colab( which failed due to limited availability of RAM) 
 Now Trying with Kaggle
